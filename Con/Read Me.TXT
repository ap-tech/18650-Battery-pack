How to Use This Schematic

To utilize this schematic for your own projects, follow these steps:


Review and Understand: Familiarize yourself with the different sections of the schematic, including the microcontroller section, power management, and any peripheral interfaces.

Customize:

Microcontroller: Adapt the pin assignments and peripheral connections to match your SAMD21 microcontroller.


Peripherals: Add or remove components for specific sensors, displays, communication modules, or other functionalities your handheld device requires.

Create PCB Layout: Once you are satisfied with the schematic, use KiCad's PCB editor to design your custom printed circuit board based on this schematic. Ensure proper component footprints and routing for optimal performance.


Important Considerations

Component Selection: While the schematic provides placeholders, ensure you select appropriate components with the correct voltage ratings, current capabilities, and package types for your application, especially those related to the 24V input and 3-cell 18650 battery pack.

Battery Management: The 24V charging circuit is designed for basic power input to charge a 3-cell 18650 battery pack. For proper and safe charging of Li-Ion batteries like 18650s, it is crucial to integrate a dedicated Battery Management System (BMS) IC. This BMS should handle aspects like cell balancing, over-charge protection, over-discharge protection, and over-current protection to ensure battery longevity and safety. The schematic provides the power path, but a comprehensive BMS is highly recommended for the battery pack.

Safety: Always exercise caution when working with electrical circuits, especially those involving higher voltages and Li-Ion batteries. Double-check your connections and component ratings. Improper handling of Li-Ion batteries can be dangerous.

Testing: Thoroughly test your assembled board, starting with power supply checks, before connecting sensitive components or full functionality.
