# 18650-Battery-pack
This is a repository for making 18650 Battery packs. I will be making 3cell, 4cell, and 6cell. All packs will have inbuilt battery balancer from AliExpress I will also be looking at charging with just an off the shelf 24v power supply or transformer. The reason for this is so that you don't need to use "hard to come by" hobby modle chargers
